/**
 * Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions
 * surrounded by 'X'.
 * 
 * A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded
 * region.
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * 
 * Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any 'O' on
 * the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'. Any 'O' that is not on the
 * border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to
 * 'X'. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected
 * horizontally or vertically.
