/**
 * You want to build a word cloud, an infographic where the size of a word
 * corresponds to how often it appears in the body of text.
 * 
 * To do this, you'll need data. Write code that takes a long string and builds
 * its word cloud data in a hash map â†´ , where the keys are words and the values
 * are the number of times the words occurred.
 * 
 * Think about capitalized words. For example, look at these sentences:
 * 
 * "After beating the eggs, Dana read the next step:" "Add milk and eggs, then
 * add flour and sugar."
 * 
 * What do we want to do with "After", "Dana", and "add"? In this example, your
 * final hash map should include one "Add" or "add" with a value of 222. Make
 * reasonable (not necessarily perfect) decisions about cases like "After" and
 * "Dana".
 * 
 * Assume the input will only contain words and standard punctuation.
