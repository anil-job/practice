 * 
 * 
 * I figured out how to get rich: online poker.
 * 
 * I suspect the online poker game I'm playing shuffles cards by doing a single
 * riffle. â†´
 * 
 * To prove this, let's write a method to tell us if a full deck of cards
 * shuffledDeck is a single riffle of two other halves half1 and half2.
 * 
 * We'll represent a stack of cards as an array of integers in the range 1...52
 * (since there are 52 distinct cards in a deck).
 * 
 * Here's a rigorous definition of the riffle algorithm:
 * 
 * cut the deck into halves half1 and half2 grab a random number of cards from
 * the top of half1 (could be 0, must be less than or equal to the number of
 * cards left in half1) and throw them into the shuffledDeck grab a random
 * number of cards from the top of half2 (could be 0, must be less than or equal
 * to the number of cards left in half2) and throw them into the shuffledDeck
 * repeat steps 2-3 until half1 and half2 are empty.
